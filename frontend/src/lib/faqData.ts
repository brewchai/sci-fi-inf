        question: "What is The Eureka Feed?",

        question: "Do you use AI?",
        answer: "Our curation algorithm is deterministic—no AI involved in selecting papers. We score them based on recency, citation potential, and topic diversity. AI only comes into play afterward: to summarize the text and generate the audio narration."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I trust the content?",
        answer: "Every summary is grounded in real papers with real text, and we link to the original source so you can verify. We're not perfect—if you spot an error, please contact us."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you curate papers?",
